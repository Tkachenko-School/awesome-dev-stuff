Some notable companies using Google Cloud Platform (App Engine or Compute Engine) include HSBC, Home Depot, Spotify, HTC, Best Buy, Snapchat, Coca Cola, Domino’s, Philips, Feedly, Sony Music, ShareThis, and Ubisoft. Moreover, Apple has also been seen moving some of its services away from Amazon Web Services, spending between $400 million & $600 million on the Google Cloud Platform; although this could not be independently confirmed.

AWS vs Google Cloud: We Asked the Devs

In the end, you could say this comes down to a matter of opinion, based on the needs of the particular product or project you're working on. While that's true, the research clearly shows certain advantages with choosing AWS and others with choosing GCP.

Amazon Glacier: This storage service is ideal for backups that aren’t accessed very often or at all. 
This service is cheaper since this storage doesn’t have to be very active. 
Glacier also allows for swifter data retrieval from huge loads of data.

We start with VMs. Creating VMs normally takes around 45–60 seconds. For example on DigitalOcean VMs are up (meaning ping starts responding) after around 40 seconds, but You need another ~15 seconds for all the systems services to be up (and most importantly — ssh server being able to accept connections).

Key Considerations for a Smart Cloud Migration Strategy

Refactor: The application is re-architected using the cloud-native features. Developers may reuse the language, or use cloud-native features, frameworks, or containers (Platform-as-a-Service or PaaS). This is often expensive, but usually, it is chosen when you opt to address new business requirements by adding new features or want to enhance the scalability and performance of the application.

Some companies have switched to the cloud during their history, as it was with Netflix. It started moving toward the cloud more than ten years ago, after the significant incident with their infrastructure. One of their database servers corrupted and the whole company could not operate for a day or two – they were sending DVDs at the time, and could not do it.

If you carefully observe, the internet is dominated by a few technology companies, the ‘Big Tech’. In fact, the internet is dominated by only a handful of ten big companies, according to a blog post published by Mashable. Too much centralization also means that the governments can ban your access to any application, leaving you with no other options whatsoever.
