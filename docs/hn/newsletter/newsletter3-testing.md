11 Reasons Why Software Testing Has a Better Future Than Development
Challenges are neither new to developers nor testers. However, building logic and testing logic carry different meanings. You have to think a lot to test the logic behind every piece of code that works in the software. IT companies are still waiting for the real talent to dedicate themselves into the job.

Why Your Project's 1st Commit Should Have a Working App & CI/CD Pipeline
Developers like reuse and fewer barriers, the business likes savings, and an enterprise likes productivity and innovation. However, to inject those benefits is still a very manual, time consuming process, making the overall sell of DevOps harder.

Behavior-Driven Development From Scratch [101]
The starting point is always a scenario, defining the needs of the user. Without this, you can not create software that matters. This "specification" must be made with the main stakeholder: the user (or at least one person who represents and understands him).

Test-Driven Development is Fundamentally Wrong
The second problem here is that TDD presumes that developers should write their own tests. This is supremely ridiculous. I’ve seen this many, many times; the project appears solid to me, I can't break it, but someone else can break it in less than a minute. Why?
Because the same blind spots that I had in design will appear in my tests.

Why AI & ML Will Shake Software Testing up in 2019

The problem of ignored bugs is very diverse and bears extremely negative consequences. We all know how traditional testing works at this moment. If you do not devote enough attention to data management, then, as a result, you will receive a whole bunch of ignored bugs. But that’s not all, because as a result, you get an unsatisfied customer and spoil the brand’s reputation.

Three Patterns for an Effective Cloud Native Development Workflow
Obviously services should be designed to be as cohesive and loosely coupled as possible, which means that the can be developed in isolation. However, when this is not practical, or an engineer wants to drive a more production-like test, techniques like service virtualisation and consumer-driven contracts can be useful patterns.

Finding defects and spend the time in discussing and documenting them. And then wait for those defects to be fixed, for you to be able to make confirmation testing and then regression testing to be sure that the fixes did not break something else.

Let’s think about a tester’s life guide: to find bugs, to report them to the developers to be fixed, to create metrics and reports illustrating how many bugs (one more severe than the other) were found during the testing activities and to give feedback about the squashy quality of the application under test.

Construction-stage testing has one of the lowest impacts on actual product quality. Don’t get me wrong. Keep writing unit tests. But know that Unit tests are small fish in a big sea. If you really want to write quality software, your focus should be somewhere else.

Transitioning from Software Testing to Development
By @uridah https://hackernoon.com/@uridah
Although people belonging to Quality Assurance and Software Development are wheels of the same vehicle, they both look at the same things with slightly different perspectives. For instance, a developer might focus more on the performance of his code while for a QA Engineer, user experience would be a bigger deal. This is only natural.

In fact, one could say that regression testing is the missing link between controlling changes of the static properties of the software (configuration and code) and controlling changes of the dynamic properties of the software (the look and behaviour).

Low effort, high value. Integration tests in Redux apps.
The kind of integration tests that will give the most confidence in the correct functioning of the app are those that take the perspective of the user. The goal is to verify that once the user interacts with the application by clicking buttons, filling form elements etc., the app responds by modifying itself or performing side effects as expected.
