Intro to PH community:

Last year I onboard around 100 interns into coding workflow at my company.
All of them have different level, skillset, background.

And each time, when they have some problems - I google links and put them at one place.
I started to collect links because some questions are recurring: "How to work with GitHub", "How to code React Components better", "What project structure should Nodejs project have", etc.

And right now I'm ready to present this website to ProductHunt community.
It's not finished project, we plan to extend it in future.

Feel free to take a look and give me your feedback. Thanks for your time.

Have a nice day! -->
